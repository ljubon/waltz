We are pleased to announce that the Waltz project has just hit 10,000 commits.

![10K](/blog/assets/images/10K/10K.png)

Each commit represents a small step on our 7 year journey from project inception to where we are now.

Some highlights along the way include:

- 50+ releases
- Over 50K users using Waltz in a production setting
- Placing the project under the [FINOS](https://www.finos.org) organisation
- Many new features and enhancements

We would like to thank all those who have contributed to Waltz, either directly through code, via issues raised or just through reaching out to our team and giving us feedback.

Looking forward to see what the next 10K commits will bring!
