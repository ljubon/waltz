[Solidatus](https://www.solidatus.com/) is a fantastic piece of software for understanding your organizations data lineage:


> Using Solidatus, you can quickly create data blueprints that map how your data flows, and how itâ€™s affected, as it moves around your systems, both now and at other points in time.

> By revealing hidden opportunities, threats, and the impact of change, a Solidatus lineage blueprint delivers clarity and an enriched understanding of your data ecosystem, so you can optimize your infrastructure, operate more efficiently, and minimize risk.
